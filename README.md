# Ule

A fork of the Elm compiler. The top priority is backwards compatibility with Elm 0.19.1.

## Build from source

This is the only way to install it.

1. install the Haskell tool stack: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/#how-to-install-stack
2. clone this repository and run `stack install` in the root of it - it will take a few minutes
3. add `export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file and restart your terminal
4. you should now be able to run `ule` exactly as you would run `elm`

## Run the tests

There are two kinds of tests, both using Ule to compile open-source Elm programs:

1. compile the application with Ule and check the generated JS is the same as the Elm JS
2. (for Elm libraries) run the library tests using Ule and elm-test

The script to run all the tests is: `./test.sh`.

The test programs are in the `test` directory. Each program includes its own test script and any expected output files, generated by Elm.
