Compiling ...-- MISSING PATTERNS ----------------------------------------------- src/Main.elm

This `case` does not have branches for all possibilities:

10|>    case x of
11|>        B ->
12|>            Html.text "B"

Missing possibilities include:

    C

I would have to crash if I saw one of those. Add branches for them!

Hint: If you want to write the code for each branch later, use `Debug.todo` as a
placeholder. Read <https://elm-lang.org/0.19.1/missing-patterns> for more
guidance on this workflow.
