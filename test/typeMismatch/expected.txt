Compiling ...-- TYPE MISMATCH -------------------------------------------------- src/Main.elm

Something is off with the body of the `hello` definition:

13|     42
        ^^
The body is a number of type:

    number

But the type annotation on `hello` says it should be:

    String

Hint: Try using String.fromInt to convert it to a string?
