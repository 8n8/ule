Compiling ...-- MODULE NOT FOUND ----------------------------------------------- src/Main.elm

You are trying to import a `A` module:

4| import A
          ^
I checked the "dependencies" and "source-directories" listed in your elm.json,
but I cannot find it! Maybe it is a typo for one of these names?

    Main
    Set
    Task
    Array

Hint: If it is not a typo, check the "dependencies" and "source-directories" of
your elm.json to make sure all the packages you need are listed there!
